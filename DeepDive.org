A great idea is to create the tags file for the Python code base with ~find .
-type f -iname "*.[ch]" | etags -~ in the base of the directory.


The function that is called when Python is started from the command line is
[[file:Programs/python.c::main(int%20argc,%20char%20**argv)][here]]. This function does not do much, obviously, and hands over the
responsibility to the [[file:Modules/main.c::_Py_UnixMain(int%20argc,%20char%20**argv)][_Py_UnixMain]] function.

* TODO How is the file loaded?
